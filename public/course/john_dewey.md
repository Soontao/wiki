## 教育 Education

> Dewey's educational theories were presented in My Pedagogic Creed (1897),  The School and Society (1900),  The Child and the Curriculum (1902),  Democracy and Education (1916) and Experience and Education (1938).  Several themes recur throughout these writings.  Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes,  and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place.  In addition,  he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum,  and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning. 
>

>
> ...
>
> This is the most famous quotation of John Dewey.
>
> My group has discussed about this sentence, everyone has different ideas, but we all agree with this quotation.Ok,XXX,express your opinion to others.
>
> ...
>
> In fact, I couldn't find the source of the quote ,but I found a paragraph similar to it.
>
> In his first educational book, My Pedagogic Creed (1897), 'Article two, What the school is', he wrote down that "I believe that education,  therefore,  is a process of living and not a preparation for future living. ", To understand the sentence,  we should to know what is education, fortunately, In his "ARTICLE ONE.  WHAT EDUCATION IS", he explains that "I believe that all education proceeds by the participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race.  This process begins unconsciously almost at birth,  and is continually shaping the individual's powers,  saturating his consciousness,  forming his habits,  training his ideas,  and arousing his feelings and emotions.  ", for Dewey, the education means the process that humans learn new things from society from the cradle to the grave, so he could held that 'Education is life itself'. 
> For me, this sentence is the truth, human beings need continuous learning, to adapt to different living environment. There is nothing wrong with this sentence, but it is meaningless, whether or not people understand this sentence, they have already done it , after all, this is a noun interpretation problems.



> 杜威的教育理论发表在. . . . . . . 中. 几个主题贯穿了这些著作. 杜威坚定地认为, 教育和学习是社会和互动的过程, 因此学校本身就是一个社会制度, 通过它, 社会改革可以并且应该发生. 此外, 他认为, 学生在一个被允许体验和互动课程的环境中茁壮成长, 所有的学生都应该有机会参加他们自己的学习. 
> 在他的第一个教育书籍, 我的教育信条(1897), "学校是什么"中, 他写下了:"我认为我们的教育是一个生活的过程, 而不是为将来的生活所做的准备", 要理解这句话, 我们需要知道教育是什么, 幸运的是, 是什么在他的 "教育是什么". 他解释说, "我相信, 所有的教育都是由个人参与到种族的社会意识中所进行的. 这个过程开始不知不觉地在诞生, 并不断发展个人的能力, 使他的意识, 形成他的习惯, 锻炼他的思想, 并激发他的感情和情绪. ". 杜威认为, 教育是指人类从社会中学习新事物的过程, 所以他可以认为"教育就是生命本身". 
> 对于我来说, 这句话说的有一定的道理, 漫长的人生中, 人类需要不断的学习, 去适应不同的生存环境. 这句话本身没什么错, 但是它没什么意义,无论人们是否理解这句话, 他们都已经在这样做了. 说到底,这就是一个名词解释的问题.

Quote 

>   Education is not preparation for life,  education is life itself. -- John Dewey

Our View

*   I think in the other words ,it is to say that every person is never too late to learn.On the world the new knowledge is more and more ,so that it's growth more faster than we learn it ,Even we are graduated,there is still a lot of knowledge that we never touched , so it's never too old to learn. 

>   Because education is life itself,as long as we are alive, we can learn new things ,So at any time, learning is not too late .

*   Education is full of our life ,Life,in fact,is a process of education,since all of us are born with nothing, just like white papers.The only way to adapt to environment is to receive education from our life in every respect .Studying in school is just one aspect of education, and more education we receive is from our life.

>   We learn many things from our surounding things in any time.

*   I agree to the opinion that education is life itself. In my opinion, education should be a non-stop process through out someone's life. For youngs as students, education means going to school and trying to have good grades; for middle-ages, education means learning to become more professional and more wise; for olds, education means a elegant way to fill life with joy. Education should be thought as a elegant way to have a better life rather than only a guarantee for high salary. Education acts differently in different life stages, but it will always give us remarkable ability to get ourselves a happy and elegant attitude to life.


>   People of different ages have different education.

My Pedagogic Creed

* ARTICLE TWO. WHAT THE SCHOOL IS
  I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.

* ARTICLE ONE. WHAT EDUCATION IS
  I believe that all education proceeds by the participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race. This process begins unconsciously almost at birth, and is continually shaping the individual's powers, saturating his consciousness, forming his habits, training his ideas, and arousing his feelings and emotions. 

## 访问中国 Visit China 

> In 1919,  while traveling in Japan on sabbatical leave,  Dewey was invited by Peking University to visit China,  probably at the behest of his former students,  Hu Shi and Chiang Monlin.  Dewey and his wife,  Alice,  arrived in Shanghai on May 1,  1919,  just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in Shandong province to Japan.  Their demonstrations on May Fourth excited and energized Dewey,  and he ended up staying in China for two years,  leaving in July 1921. 
> In these two years,  Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in The New Republic and other magazines.  Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of Bolshevism to some Chinese,  Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms,  not revolution.  Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures,  which were interpreted by Hu Shi.  For these audiences,  Dewey represented "Mr.  Democracy" and "Mr.  Science, " the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius".  Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact,  however,  was on the forces for progressive education in China,  such as Hu Shi and Chiang Monlin,  who had studied with him,  and Tao Xingzhi,  who had studied at Columbia School of Education
> Dewey's education thought had a great influence on the Chinese education circle and the thought circle in the first half of twentieth Century. Some important characters such as Hu Shi, Tao Xingzhi, Guo Bingwen, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin and so on in the Republic of China have studied in the United States of America, was a student of Dewey. He opposed the traditional teaching and mechanical training, stressed that the practice of learning from the education ideas, Cai Yuanpei, Yan Yangchu and Mao Zedong, and so have a certain impact.



>1919年, 在日本旅行在休假期间, 受到以前学生胡适和蒋梦麟的请求, 杜威接受北京大学邀请, 访问中国. 杜威和他的妻子, Alice, 于1919年5月1日抵达上海, 5月4日, 学生示威者走上北京街头, 抗议巴黎和会割让山东德占领土给日本的决定. 他们的示威活动激发和激励了杜威, 他最终在中国呆了两年, 在1921年7月离开了中国. 
>在这两年中, 杜威给中国观众发表了近200次演讲, 并几乎每月为The New Republic和其他杂志的美国人写文章. 充分了解到日本的扩张主义进入中国和共产主义对于一些中国人的吸引力, 杜威主张美国人应该支持中国的转型, 主张中国应该以教育和社会改革为基础, 而不是革命. 成百上千的人参加了由胡适担任翻译的讲座. 对于这些观众来说, 杜威代表的是"德先生"和"赛先生", 两个被认为是现代价值的代表的特质, 因此称他为"第二个孔子". 然而, 杜威最大的影响是对中国的渐进式教育/进步主义教育的影响, 胡适和蒋梦麟曾经跟着他一起做过研究, 陶行知, 也曾在哥伦比亚大学教育学院求学. 
>杜威的教育思想曾对二十世纪上半叶的中国教育界、思想界发生过重大影响。民国时期一些重要人物如胡适、陶行知、郭秉文、张伯苓、蒋梦麟等均曾在美国哥伦比亚大学留学，曾是杜威的学生。他反对传统的灌输和机械训练、强调从实践中学习的教育主张，对蔡元培、晏阳初以至毛泽东等都有一定的影响。
